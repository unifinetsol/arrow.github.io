        <p>The ever-increasing dependence on IT to deliver business services has created a need for greater data center capacity. To ensure business agility, data center facilities must be as flexible as the IT infrastructure they house. As your business grows and your data center ages, you’ll have to face some tough decisions about how to meet the increasing demands on your data center. Will you modernize the existing facility, build a new data center to accommodate future growth, or relocate to a co-location facility? ATT expert consultants can help you choose the option that best fits your company’s capacity requirements.</p>

                <img src="../images/storage.png" alt="data center">
                <p>The leap from data measured in megabytes to gigabytes to petabytes has spawned big challenges. Any compromise to data integrity, availability or security can have serious ramifications on productivity, stakeholder confidence and regulatory compliance – all of which impact your bottom line. To rise above these challenges, your business needs more than a simple storage solution. You need a multi-tiered strategy that can prioritize data and efficiently archive, access and retrieve data using Network Attached Storage (NAS) and Storage Area Network (SAN) technologies. You also need a reliable backup system in place to handle disasters.</p>

                <p>In increasingly complex business environments – especially those involving multiple and/or remote sites and mobile users – managing communication and cooperative work efforts can be challenging. The combination of virtualization technologies, cloud and converged infrastructure can significantly improve infrastructure management, improve service levels and reduce costs.</p>
